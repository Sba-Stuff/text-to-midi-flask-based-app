# text-to-midi-flask-based-app
James Skripchuk's code to convert music to midi. I am goint to convert this into flask based app. It uses NLTK to read files, then convert to sentences, then words and then turn those words into awesome piece of music. Core work is done by James Skripchuk, I just gave the proper interface to his work.
